TODO
----

This file contains an imcomplete list of things to be done, not necessarily ordered by importance or urgence.


* [DONE] Add tests for threadsafety parameter in .lfg file

* [FIXED] Rotating logger should preserve filename extension when creating timestamp files.

* add possibility to define my own line macros placeholders

* [DONE] get values for macro placeholders from Properties and subst in log line

* make benchmarks and publish them in users guide

* [DONE] Add possibility of having two types of loggers: "single threaded" (thread UNSAFE) and "multi threaded" (thread SAFE).
Thread safe logger can be called from multiple threads simultaneously. It uses std:: mutex for synchronization.

* [DONE] Add ability to use LogEngine library as header only lib. "Header only" mode will be turned on by defining global symbol LOGENGINE_HEADDER_ONLY in project settings. After that it is anough to do #include "LogEngine.h" to start using the library.

* think of error_hanler for specific logger. what errors we should track?
e.g. cannot create log file during GetLogger operation or during logger construction without GetLogger call

* [DONE] Add callback logger type. User will be able to provide his own function (or lambda) that will be called on each log message of this logger.

* [DONE] Added default logger. This is stdout loggers that can be accessed like this LogEngine::Warn(), LogEngine::ErrorFmt(), etc.

* [DONE] .h file with LogEngine version defines LOGENGINE_VER_MAJOR, LOGENGINE_VER_MINOR, LOGENGINE_VER_PATCH.

* collect statistics from Sinks. interface for that + method whether Sink collects statistic or not.

* add color logging to console.

* [DONE] configurable Date and/or Time format in log line. Done via logger and sink properties functionality

* Add support to different log destinations: file, syslog, Windows event log, OutputDebugString, probably pipes.

* Rename msvc project LogEngine to LogEngine2?

* [DONE] add possibility to configure loggers from config (.lfg) file

* [DONE] add configuration to write logs into stdout and stderr

* Add possibility to write logs with << operator: LOG(INFO) << "logstr1" << "logstr2"

* [DONE] add Async mode for writing logs. where logs are put into memory container and another thread performs actual routing and writing to file(s).

* [DONE] Add possibility to write logs into multiple files 

* Get the version number from current module (for Windows only)

* [DONE] Add a set of help functions FormatError, FormatInfo which returns formatted 
  string for InternalWrite. They helps us to write tests more comfortable.

* Add separator line ??????

* [DONE] Synchronization logs in separate thread.

* [DONE] Add log file rotation. 1->2, 2->3 .... 

* [DONE] DateTimeMacro works wrong (as TimeMacro)
