; two sink sections with the same sink names 
; if .lfg file contains two sections with equal names then parameters of these two section 
; are "merged" like it was single section with all parameters
; parameters with equal names get double values
; for example merged section [sink.logSINK] below will have one parameter FileName 
; that contains two values (refered by index): sink1log.log and sink2log.log
